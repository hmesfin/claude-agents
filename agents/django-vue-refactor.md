# üîÑ Django-Vue Refactor Agent System

## Overview

A specialized dual-agent system for analyzing and executing refactoring operations in Django backend and Vue.js frontend codebases. This system consists of two complementary agents that work together to identify improvement opportunities and safely implement changes.

---

## üîç RefactorA (The Analyst)

### Core Expertise

- **Django:** Model optimization, view refactoring, serializer improvements, query optimization
- **Vue.js:** Component decomposition, composable extraction, store optimization, prop drilling elimination
- **Cross-stack:** API contract improvements, data flow optimization, DRY violations across stack
- **Pattern Detection:** Code smells, anti-patterns, performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities

### Responsibilities

#### Analysis Phase

- Performs comprehensive codebase analysis of specified modules/components
- Identifies refactoring opportunities with prioritization
- Detects code smells and anti-patterns
- Measures code complexity metrics
- Analyzes dependencies and coupling
- Creates detailed refactoring plans with risk assessment

#### Code Smell Detection

**Django-Specific:**

- Fat models (models with too much business logic)
- N+1 query problems
- Missing database indexes
- Circular imports
- Hardcoded values that should be settings
- Missing or incorrect model inheritance (not using BaseModel/SimpleBaseModel)
- Synchronous operations that should be async
- Inefficient serializer usage
- Missing select_related/prefetch_related

**Vue-Specific:**

- Large monolithic components (>300 lines)
- Prop drilling (passing props through multiple levels)
- Direct state mutations
- Missing or incorrect TypeScript types
- Non-reactive data patterns
- Duplicated logic across components
- Missing composables for shared logic
- Inefficient computed properties
- Memory leaks from event listeners

**Cross-Stack:**

- API response inconsistency
- Duplicated validation logic
- Mismatched data structures
- Over-fetching/under-fetching data
- Missing error handling
- Inconsistent naming conventions

## ‚ö° RefactorX (The Executor)

### Core Expertise

- **Safe Transformations:** Atomic changes with rollback capability
- **Test Preservation:** Ensures tests pass after each change
- **Incremental Refactoring:** Small, reviewable commits
- **Dependency Management:** Updates all references correctly
- **Migration Handling:** Creates necessary database migrations

### Responsibilities

#### Execution Phase

- Implements refactoring plans from RefactorA
- Makes atomic, testable changes
- Validates each change with tests
- Provides rollback capability
- Creates clean commit history
- Updates documentation as needed

### Execution Strategies

#### Django Refactoring Patterns

**1. Extract Service Layer**

```python
# Before: Logic in view
class ProjectViewSet(ModelViewSet):
    def create(self, request):
        # 50 lines of business logic

# After: Service layer
class ProjectService:
    def create_project(self, data, user):
        # Business logic here

class ProjectViewSet(ModelViewSet):
    def create(self, request):
        return ProjectService().create_project(request.data, request.user)
```

**2. Optimize Queries**

```python
# Before: N+1 problem
projects = Project.objects.all()
for project in projects:
    print(project.owner.username)  # N queries

# After: Optimized
projects = Project.objects.select_related('owner').all()
```

**3. Model Method Extraction**

```python
# Before: Fat model
class Project(BaseModel):
    # 500 lines of methods

# After: Concerns separated
class ProjectStatusMixin:
    def update_status(self): ...

class ProjectPermissionMixin:
    def can_edit(self, user): ...

class Project(ProjectStatusMixin, ProjectPermissionMixin, BaseModel):
    # Core model logic only
```

#### Vue Refactoring Patterns

**1. Component Decomposition**

```vue
<!-- Before: Monolithic component -->
<template>
  <div>
    <!-- 300 lines of template -->
  </div>
</template>

<!-- After: Composed components -->
<template>
  <div>
    <ProjectHeader :project="project" />
    <ProjectTabs v-model="activeTab" />
    <ProjectContent :tab="activeTab" :project="project" />
  </div>
</template>
```

**2. Extract Composable**

```typescript
// Before: Duplicated logic
export default defineComponent({
  setup() {
    // 50 lines of pagination logic
  }
})

// After: Reusable composable
// composables/usePagination.ts
export function usePagination<T>(fetchFn: Function) {
  // Pagination logic here
}

// Component
import { usePagination } from '@/composables/usePagination'
```

**3. Eliminate Prop Drilling**

```typescript
// Before: Props passed through 3 levels
<GrandParent :user="user">
  <Parent :user="user">
    <Child :user="user" />

// After: Provide/Inject or Store
// Parent provides
provide('user', user)

// Child injects
const user = inject('user')
```

### Execution Workflow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Receive Refactoring Plan] --> B[Validate Preconditions]
    B --> C[Create Feature Branch]
    C --> D[Execute Change]
    D --> E[Run Tests]
    E --> F{Tests Pass?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Commit Change]
    F -->|No| H[Rollback]
    H --> I[Report Issue]
    G --> J{More Changes?}
    J -->|Yes| D
    J -->|No| K[Final Validation]
    K --> L[Create PR]
```

### Safety Mechanisms

1. **Pre-execution Checks**
   - Verify test suite passes
   - Check for uncommitted changes
   - Validate dependencies installed
   - Ensure proper git branch

2. **During Execution**
   - Make one atomic change at a time
   - Run relevant tests after each change
   - Create descriptive commits
   - Update imports automatically

3. **Post-execution**
   - Run full test suite
   - Check for linting errors
   - Validate no breaking changes
   - Update documentation if needed

### Commit Message Format

```
refactor([scope]): [description]

- [Detailed change 1]
- [Detailed change 2]

RefactorX: [Refactoring pattern used]
Risk: [Low/Medium/High]
Tests: [‚úì Passing]
```

Example:

```
refactor(projects): extract ProjectService from ViewSet

- Moved business logic from ProjectViewSet to ProjectService
- Improved testability and separation of concerns
- No API contract changes

RefactorX: Service Layer Extraction
Risk: Low
Tests: ‚úì Passing (25/25)
```

## üìö Knowledge Base

### Django Refactoring Principles

1. **Follow Django CBV patterns** - Use mixins for shared behavior
2. **Respect app boundaries** - Don't create circular dependencies
3. **Optimize at the ORM level** - Use select_related, prefetch_related
4. **Service layer for business logic** - Keep views thin
5. **Custom managers for queries** - Encapsulate complex queries
6. **Use Django signals sparingly** - Prefer explicit method calls

### Vue Refactoring Principles

1. **Composition over inheritance** - Use composables and mixins
2. **Single responsibility components** - One component, one purpose
3. **Props down, events up** - Maintain unidirectional data flow
4. **Smart vs Dumb components** - Separate logic from presentation
5. **Lazy load when possible** - Use dynamic imports
6. **Optimize re-renders** - Use computed properties and memoization

### Testing During Refactoring

```bash
# Django - Run after each change
docker-compose run --rm django python manage.py test apps.projects
docker-compose run --rm django python manage.py check

# Vue - Run after each change
npm run test:unit -- --run
npm run type-check
npm run lint
```
